John Ko’s EQ Data by Grok3
To create a spider diagram (also known as a radar chart) for John Ko’s scores, I will use the provided data: Sports (3), Leadership skills (5), Integrity (5), Sharing (6), and Sacrifice (7). A spider diagram is ideal for visualizing multivariate data, with each axis representing a category and the score plotted on that axis, connected to form a polygon. Since Leadership skills and Integrity have the same score (5), they will be represented on separate axes but with the same radial distance, and the chart will use distinct colors for clarity, consistent with the previous color assignments:

Sports (3): Red
Leadership skills (5): Blue
Integrity (5): Blue
Sharing (6): Green
Sacrifice (7): Yellow
As per the instructions, I will produce a Chart.js radar chart configuration in a code block, ensuring distinct colors suitable for both light and dark themes, and refer to it as a “chart” in the explanation.
